# this was produced using time_until_failure.py
# which plays an N-qubit stabilizer game with 0 stacked observations
# with random guessing until failure, for 2 <= N <= 9.
# As the results (averaged over 500 runs per N) indicate, random guessing
# suffices for an exponentially scaling number of iterations.
